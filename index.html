  <p>Take a look around this web adress I debuted myself. It ain't much [...].</p><br>
  <br>
  <p> In the meantime, while content is added, please take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the clean masterfull design of this hi-fi record player, the<br>
  <p><stong>Braun Wall Unit</stong> designed by Dieter Rams (weisbaden, Germany, 1932). It's made up of diferent parts: the TS 45 receiver, TG 60 reel-to-reel tape recorder, 2 L 450 speakers, and a PCS 5 turntable. </p><br>
  <p>This wall-mounted assemblage is not only a true deign icon, but a sofisticated machineâ€”in the sense which Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari understood the term: as a device which drives, conducts, and modulates desire.</p><br>
  <p>Shine on you crazy dimond</p>
